I see your point, but I think you should differ between “styling and showoff” and design, which is in a large part visual.

Also the content needs to be more than authentic. It needs to be good — and a good product needs a good design as part of its core just as the ‘content’ or story.

Still I can see where the basic misconseption is so I like this article very much.
